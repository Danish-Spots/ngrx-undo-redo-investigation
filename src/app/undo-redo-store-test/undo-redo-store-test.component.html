<h1>Changelog</h1>
<h2>1.1</h2>
<p>
  Changed how undo redo functionality works. Now it does not calculate new state on undo from intial state. Instead it
  calculates it based on the payload. So if the payload is add, then it just removes the item from state. If the payload
  is edit, then it stores the original value, using a key and value. This is then used to transform the current value on
  undo, by using the original value and its key. Have alook at the platform reducer on undo action to learn more.
</p>
<h2>1.0</h2>
<p>
  Initial version of this app where you can see how undo redo functionality can work using NgRx. It works by storing
  each action as an undo action and then on undo, calculates state from initial state by iterating over all undo actions
  minus 1. It then stores the most recent undo action in the redo actions so you can go back to the most recent state.
  To learn more look at the platform reducer. It uses effects to handle creating these undo undo actions.
